Totara test scripts
===================

Before every Totara release we run the site through a number of automated tests
in order to check for common bugs and errors.

PLEASE ONLY RUN THESE TESTS IN A DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT!! They are not designed
To be run on a live site.

link_checker.php
----------------

Spiders a site, following any internal links it finds, and records any errors it
comes across. Can be run as many different users. Call from the command line:

php link_checker.php sitename [username] [user password] [startpage]
