Totara test scripts
===================

Before every Totara release we run the site through a number of automated tests
in order to check for common bugs and errors.

Typically these tests will work for any Moodle 1.9 site and should also be
suitable for Moodle 2.0 installations too.

PLEASE ONLY RUN THESE TESTS IN A DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT!! They are not designed
To be run on a live site.

link_checker.php
----------------

Spiders a site, following any internal links it finds, and records any errors it
comes across. Can be run as many different users. Call from the command line:

php link_checker.php [sitename] [username] [user password]
